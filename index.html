                  <P>
                 2.Exponential Regression: Fits an exponential model to the data, which is suitable for data that grows or decays exponentially.

               <P>
             3.Logarithmic Regression: Fits a logarithmic model to the data, which is useful for data that exhibits logarithmic growth or decay
           </P>
          <P>
         4.Weighted Least Squares: Assigns different weights to data points, giving more importance to certain data points while fitting the curve. This is useful when you have confidence information for each data point.
